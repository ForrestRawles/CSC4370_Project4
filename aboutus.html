                <p>Responsibilities:<br>
                    Hello, my name is Forrest Rawles, and I hope your having a great day. I work on 2 main portions of
                    the website; the user registration and the seller section.
                    The user registration is a very important aspect for any website, where all the information must be
                    stored properly. The seller pages require the user to have an ui that
                    shows all the property that they are selling or an add button. The add button redirects the user to
                    a page that lets them put their property information.
                </p>

                <h4>How Was Scrum Beneficial to You During this Project?</h4>
                Scrum helped us organized key portions of the project that we needed to do in a short amount of time.
                There is so much going on, so being able to work on sections and
                talk to each other when we needed help worked well in the long run. Each time we meet up, we had ideas
                to each other's problem, so it made our team more efficent.
                There were a lot of bugs, and being able to talk and have others give their perspective was a huge
                benifit. For the future, SCRUM would be really useful for just programming in big teams.
                There could be big projects where the deadline is in a short amount of time, and SCRUM could help spread
                the workload effiecently to each programmer on the team. It would lead to
                a bit less stress in the working enviorment.

                <h3>Tori Padgett</h3>
                <p>As one of the team members on this project, Tori took on multiple different tasks throughout the
                    site. From building and establishing
                    the lovely homepage you see upon first entering the site, to designing the styling for the signup,
                    login, and buttons, as well as creating the
                    administrative page for administrators to view, Tori had her hands in a little bit of everything
                    when building this site. More specific responsibilities
                    include the creation of the admin page plus the statistics to show admins, the styling on most
                    pages, and verifying that all components on the page
                    were opperating as expected.</p>
                <h4>How Was Scrum Beneficial to You During this Project?</h4>
                <p>Keeping up with my group members using the Scrum methodology was really the only way I was able to
                    keep myself flexible and cover
                    so many parts of the project. By having daily meetings with my team, I was really able to see what
                    my team members were working on, and find
                    quick places to fill in to help get the project built. It also helped me solve a bunch of problems
                    easily by mentioning them to my team on the daily and us being able to have quick solutions ready to
                    fix items that were not working properly such as the login
                    page logging in all users as admins at one point. I believe Scrum will be beneficial to me in the
                    fiture as it will allow me to get quick answers to my
                    questions inside the daily meeting format and also allow me to find spaces quickly and easily that
                    need help so I can make sure that our site in the future
                    is fully flushed out.

                <h3>Marcos Crawford</h3>
                <p>Marcos Crawford took on the task of building the buyer page of the website. This required a system of
                    creating a database for each user that wants to sign up, as
                    each buyer needs a wishlist for the properties they want to buy. He also had a help in debugging
                    some of the other's code. He mainly also helped the login page gain it's footing to make it
                    functional.

                <h4>How Was Scrum Beneficial to You During this Project?</h4>
                <p>
                    I really like the fact that I was able to keep up with my teammates all the time. That way I could
                    always keep on top on what they were doing and help them out when
                    they needed it. In turn, they were also able to help me out when I hit some roadblocks. This
                    methodology will be beneficial to me in the future because of the fact that
                    it really allows for easier communication and it also implicitly pushes people to get stuff done
                    immediately instead of procrastinating (something that I'm usually prone to!).

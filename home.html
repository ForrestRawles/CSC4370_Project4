                    We're Cornerstone, the newest application allowing you to buy or sell your home online. By signing up as
                    either a buyer or a seller,
                    you can either look at potential homes to buy in your area being sold by trusted sellers, or sell
                    your home to potential buyers. We
                    know that especially with the housing market skyrocketing again that it's getting harder and harder
                    to find a place to stay, which is why
                    we are bringing to you an easy platform to find a home that's prefect for you!

                    We provide an easy to use platform to look at purchasing a home. Each home is displayed in a card
                    style format in order to provide you
                    with ease of access viewing of the home, such as location, square feet, garden access, and more.
                    Purchasing a home is already complicated, we
                    want to make the process of viewing them that much easier by providing you with the important
                    information you're looking for up front. And for
                    sellers, we want to make the process of listing your home as pain free as possible since we know
                    it's just as chatoic of a time for you as well.
                    We provide you a very easy menu to list and sell your home, were you can provide the information
                    needed to sell your home in a matter of minutes.
                    Moving is complicated and stressful, and we're here to provide you with an easier time showcasing
                    your home in order to help make the process
                    just a little easier.

            <div class="whyUsBody">
                So why would you list with us instead of one of the other real estate applications out there. We can
                promise that after listing your home on our
                site, you will have the top viewing ability for at least the first 48 hours after your home is listed.
                By being one of the first homes listed
                on our site, you will recieve the most viewings on your home, and potentially offers soon after it's
                listed do to this. We strive to guarentee that
                your home will not be lost burried under other listings by working on this, allowing you to not have to
                stress on if buyers will ever see your listing.
                And for buyers, we promise to keep listings up to date and accurate with homes on the market for you to
                look at. That way you aren't looking at potential
                homes that are under contract or sold and just remaining on the site which other companies happen to
                leave up. We strive to make this time as easy as possible
                for all parties involved by offering up to date listings and priority for new listsings to help you find
                a home or sell your home.
